## Why OMK

Choose a model, work on your repository, then switch models with `/model` when
another one suits the next step. The conversation stays in the same session.
You can also stop and return later with `/resume` or `omk -c`.

OMK is a standalone CLI, not a plugin for Claude Code or OpenCode. It supports
[subscription providers, API keys, and local models](packages/coding-agent/docs/providers.md).
Start with one agent that reads files, edits code, and runs commands. Add
subagents or explicit verification workflows when you need them; neither is
required for your first task.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 22.19 or newer. Start in the repository you want to work on:

```bash
npm install -g open-multi-agent-kit --ignore-scripts
omk --version
cd your-project
omk
```

Without a global install, run `npx --ignore-scripts open-multi-agent-kit` from
that directory.

1. Run `/login` to authenticate a supported subscription or API-key provider.
2. Run `/model` to choose an available model.
3. Try a read-only first task:

```text
Summarize this repository and identify the commands used to check it.
Read the project configuration to support your answer. Do not edit files.
```

After the reply, use `/model` to choose another configured model and ask it to
review the answer. You stay in the same session. This is manual model switching,
not parallel agents or an independent correctness check.

For a bug fix, name the failing behavior and ask for a regression test, the
smallest fix, and the check commands with their exit codes. Review the diff and
those results yourself; a request to run tests does not enable a verification
gate.

Built-in local bash requires `sandbox-exec` on macOS or `bwrap` plus
unprivileged user namespaces on Linux. It blocks network access and fails
closed if the backend is missing. See the [safety boundary](#verification-boundary)
and [full quickstart](packages/coding-agent/docs/quickstart.md) for setup.

## What runs by default

A fresh install starts one agent/tool loop after provider setup. It does not
turn each prompt into a multi-agent workflow or automatically certify its
answer.

| Capability | Fresh-install behavior | Where to start |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File editing, shell commands, saved sessions | Built in; tools run when called by the agent | [Usage](packages/coding-agent/docs/usage.md), [sessions](packages/coding-agent/docs/sessions.md) |
| Tool-call scheduling | `dag-v2` schedules resource conflicts within the agent loop; it does not launch a team | [Runtime algorithms](packages/coding-agent/docs/runtime-algorithms.md#tool-scheduling-and-settlement) |
| Subagents | Optional extension; load it and supply agent definitions | [Subagent setup and examples](packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent/README.md) |
| MCP servers, extra skills and extensions | Require configured servers or installed resources | [MCP](packages/coding-agent/docs/mcp.md), [skills](packages/coding-agent/docs/skills.md), [extensions](packages/coding-agent/docs/extensions.md) |
| Protocol verification and advisory judging | Explicit API/workflow opt-in; not a gate on ordinary prompts | [Run protocol](packages/coding-agent/docs/run-protocol.md) |
| Context budgeting | Off by default | [Settings](packages/coding-agent/docs/settings.md#context-budget) |
| AdaptOrch integration | Optional and separate; no service calls by default | [OMK + AdaptOrch](#omk--adaptorch) |

The internal lane launcher and automatic command-sharding primitives are not
connected to the default CLI path. Installing their packages is not the same
as enabling an orchestration workflow.

## Evidence and limits

No comparative benchmark result is published here yet. We have not established
that OMK solves more tasks than another harness, that multi-agent execution
improves success, or how much verification reduces false completion.

OMK targets state-of-the-art quality as a CLI coding-agent harness.
SOTA is not verified.

The evidence you can inspect today covers specific failure modes:

| Behavior covered | Regression evidence | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing test observations produce `inconclusive`; a required failing test produces `fail` | [Protocol tests](packages/protocol/test/protocol.test.ts) | Explicit protocol evaluation, without a waiver |
| Changed artifacts, wrong command bindings, or missing ledger evidence block acceptance | [Evidence binding tests](packages/coding-agent/test/evidence-gate-binding.test.ts) | Strict evidence gate and selected workspace scope |
| A relevant workspace mutation after verification makes the receipt stale | [Freshness tests](packages/coding-agent/test/evidence-freshness.test.ts) | Configured receipt and mutation tracking |
| An effect that may still be live keeps its resource claims through expiry, cancellation and authority restart, until a supervisor confirms termination | [Coordination broker tests](packages/coding-agent/test/coordination-broker.test.ts) | In-process broker with canonical claim keys; no OS fencing |
| A publication is refused unless its read versions, parent revision and receipt binding all still match | [Publication tests](packages/coding-agent/test/coordination-integration.test.ts) | Single accepted snapshot pointer; no multi-file filesystem atomicity |
| Cancellation after dispatch is never reported as cancelled-before-dispatch; the outcome stays unknown until settled | [Operation lifecycle tests](packages/coding-agent/test/coordination-operation.test.ts) | Pure state machine; does not itself stop a remote effect |
| Zero trials is reported as absent evidence rather than zero risk, and a point estimate is not an error rate | [Risk bound tests](packages/coding-agent/test/metacognition-risk.test.ts) | Binomial model under a fixed policy and adequately independent samples |

These tests exercise the gates, not the rate at which they catch real bugs.
An ordinary prompt finishes when its tool loop and queued work settle;
`prompt_settled` is not a correctness verdict.

A useful comparison must hold the model, provider configuration, tasks, budget,
and tool permissions constant, and label default versus opt-in workflows.
Report task success, cost, latency, and false completion (reported complete but
failing the declared checks), with its denominator and per-task outcomes.
The [measurement protocol](packages/coding-agent/docs/metrics.md#controlled-comparison-contract)
defines the reproducibility and privacy requirements. `omk stats` shows local
turn costs and tool failures; it does not score task correctness.

If you evaluate OMK, share a sanitized report and reproduction steps in a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/dmae97/omk/issues). Include failed and
interrupted runs, not just successful examples.

## OMK//CONTROL

The terminal UI shows the selected model, tools, and session status. Additional
signals depend on the integrations you configure.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="landing/assets/omk_tui.jpg"
    alt="OMK//CONTROL terminal dashboard showing model routing, tools, and session status"
    width="960"
  />
</p>

The header reads `omk v<package.version> · OMK//CONTROL`; the installed package
version is the source of truth.

## Control loop

<details>
<summary>How scope, routing, verification, and replay fit together</summary>

OMK's provider-neutral coding-agent CLI also exposes a multi-agent control
plane for explicitly configured workflows. The diagram describes that design,
not what every prompt automatically runs.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="readmeasset/omk-control-loop.gif"
    alt="Animated OMK control loop showing Scope, Route, Verify, and Replay"
    width="900"
  />
</p>

The v0.98.3 SDK rejects incomplete first-party judge responses and exposes
deterministic ties; it is not an automatic TUI judge.

1. Scope the goal, paths, resources, and acceptance predicates. A selected
   orchestration workflow may also supply a DAG; an ordinary prompt remains
   one agent/tool loop.
2. Route work to models, agent skills, MCP tools, and extensions without
   changing the evidence contract.
3. Verify declared checks in explicit evidence workflows. Required failing
   checks block those workflows; advisory judging cannot replace them.
4. Preserve receipts and replay state for bounded session recovery; continue
   durable goals from explicit reducer state.

The animation changes once every 1.5 seconds and contains no flashing. The four
steps above are the complete text alternative.

</details>

## Verification boundary

`AgentSession` built-in local bash uses OS sandbox enforcement by default:
`sandbox-exec` on macOS and `bwrap` plus unprivileged user namespaces on Linux.
Local shell spawns restrict writes to the workspace and OS temporary directory,
disable network access, and fail closed with `sandbox.backend_missing` when an
enforcement backend is unavailable.

This is **not** read-confidentiality or whole-process containment. Other file
tools, extension and custom-tool code, injected or remote `BashOperations`, and
the OMK process keep the permissions of the process running them. Use
[containerization](packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md) when the
boundary must cover more than built-in local bash. Explicit evidence workflows
cannot treat missing required evidence as a verified result.

## Providers

<details>
<summary>Provider integrations and published packages</summary>

OMK keeps routing separate from control and evidence. Codex, Claude Code,
OpenCode Zen/Go, Kimi, GLM/ZAI, native xAI/Grok, NVIDIA NIM, and local providers
can participate through `omk-ai` while the run contract stays stable.

Native `xai` keeps subscription OAuth and `XAI_API_KEY` billing separate. See
[provider setup](packages/coding-agent/docs/providers.md),
[provider resilience](packages/coding-agent/docs/provider-resilience.md), and
[Grok integration](packages/coding-agent/docs/grok-harness.md).

## Repository understanding

<details>
<summary>Optional indexes, retrieval settings, and trust limits</summary>

`v0.97.0` shipped the OpenWiki policy and workflow, but no versioned corpus or
integrity checker. The following integrity/output guards shipped in v0.98.0;
the generated corpus remains optional and is not bundled:

- **`openwiki/`** — absent. The previous untracked corpus was removed after the
  hardened gate proved it carried fabricated evidence: 8 frontmatter symbols
  that no declared source path defines (`AgentLoop`, `getModel`, `DeepWall`,
  `loadExtensions`, `createExtensionRuntime`, `main`), 45 references to `@omk/*`
  package names this repository does not publish, and a
  restatement of this README's `Scope -> Route -> Verify -> Replay` loop as a
  strict engine state machine, which is not what the source implements.
  CI regenerates the corpus; nothing is lost.
- **`scripts/check-openwiki.mjs`** — shipped integrity checker. An `interrupted` corpus
  now fails unless `openwiki/.manual-review.json` binds a review to the exact
  corpus digest, and every frontmatter symbol must bind to one of that page's
  own `source_paths` as a whole identifier.
- **`scripts/check-openwiki-output.mjs`** — output gate. The scheduled workflow
  may write, upload, and open a PR for `openwiki/` and nothing else, so a model
  reading this repository cannot reach `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or the workflow
  that runs it. The gate runs once before the artifact leaves the read-only
  generating job and again before the PR, because the publishing job holds write
  permissions the first one does not.
- **`.understand-anything/`** — optional local structural graph used by Pi Lens;
  it is not published or injected into prompts by default. To reach a session,
  attach it through OMK's [MCP client](packages/coding-agent/docs/mcp.md) like
  any other server; there is no second, bespoke path for it.

Source and tests remain authoritative. Shipped guards do not turn a generated
index into authority: treat corpus pages as local advisory data and recheck source.

### Retrieval

A corpus no session can read is documentation of a plan, not a feature, so the
pages are now candidates for prompt budgeting. Enable `contextBudget.openwiki`
alongside `contextBudget.enabled`
([settings](packages/coding-agent/docs/settings.md#repository-wiki-retrieval))
and each page becomes a low-priority `evidence` item ranked against the turn's
query. Pages compete for leftover budget and can never displace instructions or
skills; most turns carry titles and declared symbols alone, and a page's text
arrives only when the query earns it.

Admission mirrors `scripts/check-openwiki.mjs` rather than restating it. A
complete corpus at the current `HEAD` offers page text; one whose `HEAD` has
moved offers titles only and is marked stale; an interrupted corpus is refused
unless a review binds to its exact digest. The default is off, and with the
setting off the prompt is byte-identical to one built without a corpus.

## OMK + AdaptOrch

<a href="https://adaptorch.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=omk">
  <img

    alt="OMK writes and runs code. AdaptOrch checks what it wrote. correctness_claim: false — it ran, and this is what happened."
    width="100%"
  />
</a>

OMK is this local, MIT-licensed coding agent. AdaptOrch is a separate
proprietary evidence service. Neither requires the other: installing OMK does
not create an AdaptOrch account or make calls to it by default.

For an optional integration, see the [WPL package and clients](packages/adaptorch-wpl/README.md)
and [MCP setup](packages/coding-agent/docs/mcp.md). The WPL package exposes
state, client, and adjudication primitives, not an automatic verification loop
for every CLI prompt.

AdaptOrch's reports carry `correctness_claim=false`; they are not semantic
correctness proofs or OMK harness benchmark results.

## Prior art

<details>
<summary>Research references, not OMK benchmark results</summary>

The design decisions behind OMK's context, routing, memory, and orchestration
layers are grounded in published work rather than invented in isolation. Each
row below was retrieved and read directly; claims are at abstract level, which
is the evidence grade this table asserts and no more.

## FAQ

### Why use OMK instead of Claude Code?

Use it for provider choice within one CLI session, or to build workflows
against its public runtime and evidence APIs. For a single-provider workflow,
your current agent may be sufficient. Try the [read-only task above](#quick-start)
before moving existing work.

### How is this different from OpenCode with plugins?

OMK is a separate runtime with its own CLI, sessions, tool scheduler, and SDK.
One reason to choose it is to build your own acceptance workflow: define
required test observations in the [run protocol](packages/coding-agent/docs/run-protocol.md),
then have your automation reject `fail` or `inconclusive` results. Receipt
integrity and freshness still need their own configured checks.

For adding a tool or prompt to an existing OpenCode setup, a plugin may be the
smaller change. OMK's protocol is opt-in, not proof of better performance.

### Does multi-agent mean better results or automatic verification?

Not automatically. Subagents require setup, and verification must be part of
the chosen workflow. Its result covers the declared checks, not all behavior. See
[what runs by default](#what-runs-by-default) and [evidence and limits](#evidence-and-limits).

## Release v1.2.4

### New Features

- `omk provider adopt [<id>] [--from <source>] [--dry-run] [--json] [--status]` copies an existing Codex CLI or Claude Code CLI login into OMK's credential store, so a subscription does not have to be signed in twice. Sources are read-only, `--from` narrows to the provider's own mapping, and no token material reaches output.

### Fixed

- A credential store that cannot be read is no longer treated as "no credential": request auth refuses to substitute stale environment or models.json keys, `agent-session` reports the store error instead of advising `/login`, and a transient lock contention is retried instead of deciding authentication for the whole process lifetime.
- `omk provider doctor` accepts engine-registered API types (`devin-agent`, `cursor-agent`) instead of rejecting them as unsupported.
- Compaction commits survive append-only extension state written while the summary is generated; only provably inert `custom` tails are rebased, and a `length` stop that produced no summary text fails instead of committing an empty summary. The compaction source-entry bound is 65,536.
- `addOAuthAccount` merges imported accounts inside the storage lock (no lost update across concurrent sessions) and never overwrites a usable stored refresh token with an absent one.
- A post-dispatch rejection that provably never spawned (a deadline crossing between the dispatch journal and the supervisor call) now journals the exit and settles the run instead of leaving the execution id open forever.

Release notes live in [RELEASE_NOTES_v1.2.4.md](.github/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.2.4.md).

## Release v1.2.3

### Fixed

- Verified-run suite hardening: tests use a 15s cleanup budget so slow namespace teardown on ubuntu-22.04 runners drains before settling, matching the witness contract without weakening fail-closed outcomes (no product-code change).

Release notes live in [RELEASE_NOTES_v1.2.3.md](.github/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.2.3.md).

## Release v1.2.2

### Fixed

- Verified-run termination witness: the supervisor drain now witnesses PID-namespace init death instead of enumerating the host process table, and inconclusive probes retry until the cleanup deadline instead of settling terminal `unknown` early. Host-dependent false positives (zombie tasks keeping their ns link, unreadable same-uid tasks) no longer quarantine every sandboxed dispatch — this was the ubuntu-22.04 CI failure that blocked v1.2.1 publishing.
- Test infrastructure: `./test.sh` runs the suite against an isolated agent directory (`OMK_CODING_AGENT_DIR` on a throwaway dir) instead of moving the live credential store aside for the whole run. Concurrent sessions no longer read an empty store, fall back to stale environment credentials, or have a freshly written store clobbered by the restore. The test environment preserves `OMK_CODING_AGENT_DIR` while scrubbing other `OMK_*` values so the isolation reaches spawned CLI processes.
- Compaction no longer livelocks while an extension writes session state. A summary is now committed over `custom` entries appended while it was generated (for example pi-landstrip background-task snapshots every few seconds) when the file only grew by such entries; a message, model change, provenance entry, rewrite or branch move still discards it with `revision_mismatch`.
- A compaction window may hold up to 65,536 entries (was 4,096), so a session dominated by extension state entries can compact instead of failing with `source.entryIds must be a bounded array`. An older binary cannot open a session whose compaction envelope lists more than 4,096 entries.
