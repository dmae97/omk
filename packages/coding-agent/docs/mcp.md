# MCP

OMK speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) as a
**client**: it starts configured servers, lists their tools, and exposes those
tools to the model alongside the built-in ones.

Two separate surfaces exist, and they are easy to confuse:

| Surface | Module | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inventory / health | `core/mcp-inventory.ts` | Reads configuration read-only for `omk doctor` and the MCP health view. **Never starts a server.** Env *values* are stripped. |
| Runtime client | `core/mcp/` | Starts servers, performs the handshake, and registers their tools for a session. |

## Configuration

Servers are read from three files, later wins on a name collision:

1. `~/.kimi/mcp.json`
2. `~/.omk/mcp.json`
3. `<cwd>/.omk/mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"],
      "startup_timeout_sec": 60
    },
    "serena": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/oraios/serena", "serena"],
      "env": { "SERENA_LOG_LEVEL": "error" }
    },
    "retired": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "old-server"], "disabled": true }
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `command`, `args` | Executable to spawn. **Required** — entries with only a `url` are skipped, since stdio is the supported transport. |
| `env` | Extra environment for the child. Merged over the parent environment. Values are runtime-only and are never rendered or logged. |
| `cwd` | Working directory. Defaults to the session's cwd. |
| `disabled` / `enabled: false` | Skip without deleting the entry. |
| `startup_timeout_sec` | Handshake deadline. Raise it for `npx -y …@latest` servers whose first run downloads a package. |

## Using it

The `omk` CLI calls `attachMcpServers()` for every session it creates —
interactive, `-p`, and RPC, including `/new`, `/resume`, and forks — so a
configured server's tools reach the model without further setup. An enabled
server that fails to start is reported as a startup warning and the session
continues. Intentionally disabled entries are skipped without a startup warning.
`--help` and `--list-models` never spawn servers.

SDK callers attach explicitly:

```ts
const status = await session.attachMcpServers();
// [{ name: "playwright", state: "ready", toolCount: 24, serverVersion: "1.62.0" }]

session.getToolDefinition("playwright__navigate");
```

- **Nothing is spawned until `attachMcpServers()` is called.** An SDK session
  can configure 25 servers without paying for them until it attaches.
- Tools are exposed as `<server>__<tool>`, truncated to 64 characters with the
  server prefix preserved.
- A built-in tool always wins a name collision; MCP can never shadow `bash`.
- Calling `attachMcpServers()` again replaces the previous MCP tools rather than
  duplicating them.
- `session.dispose()` terminates every server it started.

### Bounded startup

Each manager admits up to four connect/handshake/catalog attempts at once by
default. Low-level SDK callers can set a positive integer `connectionConcurrency`
in `McpManagerOptions`. This is a startup limit, not a server or tool limit: a
listing still waits for every enabled attempt and returns the full admitted
catalog in configuration order. Waiting servers report `queued`; they have not
been spawned yet. Direct connects and explicit health recovery share the queue.

Closing a manager cancels queued starts and invalidates active generations. An
active attempt keeps its slot until settlement, and late handshake/list results
cannot publish tools. Explicit post-close connects wait for the previous attempt
to settle before reconnecting. No idle-server shutdown or descriptor reduction is
introduced. Four is a conservative default, not a measured optimum: staging can
increase full-catalog readiness time while reducing simultaneous startup work.

### Failure behavior

Failures are isolated by design, because one broken server must not cost a
session:

| Failure | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Server exits during startup | That server is `failed` with its stderr tail; every other server still contributes tools. |
| Handshake exceeds `startup_timeout_sec` | Same — reported as a timeout, session unaffected. |
| Server dies mid-session | In-flight requests reject; later calls to its tools return a tool-level error instead of throwing. |
| Tool returns an MCP error | Surfaces as a normal tool result with `isError: true`, so the model sees the server's own message. |
| Server emits a non-JSON line | The line is dropped and decoding resynchronizes at the next newline. |
| Server emits a frame larger than 16 MiB | One framing error is reported; the remainder is discarded until the next newline. |

The frame limit counts raw UTF-8 bytes, including whitespace and CR in CRLF,
independently of chunk boundaries. The decoder scans only new chunks and batches
small fragments without truncating valid messages or reducing tool catalogs.
This bounds retained frame data, not the memory of parsed JSON or the whole process.

## Checking your configuration

```bash
node scripts/mcp-smoke.mjs                       # connect everything, print status
node scripts/mcp-smoke.mjs github playwright     # only these
OMK_MCP_SMOKE_HANDSHAKE_MS=120000 node scripts/mcp-smoke.mjs   # override slow handshakes
```

The script prints server state, tool counts, and versions. It never prints env
values.

### Package and credential errors

An npm `E404` happens before the MCP handshake: the configured npm package could
not be resolved. A longer `startup_timeout_sec` does not fix a wrong package name.
The server's configuration key is not necessarily its package name:

- [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7): `npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp`,
  not `npx -y context7-mcp`.
- [Fetch](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch):
  `uvx mcp-server-fetch`, not `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch`.

Check all three configuration paths above: a project entry overrides a user entry
with the same server name. Recreate the session after correcting a command.

A `No API key` error is different: the executable started but lacks credentials.
For Resend, supply `RESEND_API_KEY` securely to the server process, or explicitly
set `disabled: true` if you do not need it. Do not paste keys into diagnostic
output. Missing-key and other genuine startup failures remain warnings.

## Scope

Implemented: `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, `tools/list`,
`tools/call` over stdio.

Not implemented: HTTP/SSE transports, resources, prompts, sampling, and
server-initiated requests. Every OMK-configured server today is stdio, and
adding a surface nothing calls would be dead weight.
