# Terminal Setup

OMK uses the [Kitty keyboard protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/) for reliable modifier key detection. Most modern terminals support this protocol, but some require configuration.

## Kitty, iTerm2

Work out of the box.

## Apple Terminal

OMK enables enhanced key reporting when available. If Terminal.app still sends plain Return for `Shift+Enter`, OMK uses a local macOS modifier fallback to treat that Return as `Shift+Enter`.

This fallback only works when OMK runs on the same Mac as Terminal.app. It cannot detect the local keyboard over remote SSH.

## Ghostty

Add to your Ghostty config (`~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config` on macOS, `~/.config/ghostty/config` on Linux):

```
keybind = alt+backspace=text:\x1b\x7f
```

Older Claude Code versions may have added this Ghostty mapping:

```
keybind = shift+enter=text:\n
```

That mapping sends a raw linefeed byte. Inside OMK, that is indistinguishable from `Ctrl+J`, so tmux and OMK no longer see a real `shift+enter` key event.

If Claude Code 2.x or newer is the only reason you added that mapping, you can remove it, unless you want to use Claude Code in tmux, where it still requires that Ghostty mapping.

If you want `Shift+Enter` to keep working in tmux via that remap, add `ctrl+j` to your OMK `newLine` keybinding in `~/.omk/agent/keybindings.json`:

```json
{
  "newLine": ["shift+enter", "ctrl+j"]
}
```

## WezTerm

Create `~/.wezterm.lua`:

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'
local config = wezterm.config_builder()
config.enable_kitty_keyboard = true
return config
```

On WSL, WezTerm may require a visible hardware cursor for IME candidate window positioning. If CJK IME candidates do not follow the text cursor, set `OMK_HARDWARE_CURSOR=1` before running OMK or set `showHardwareCursor` to `true` in settings.

## VS Code (Integrated Terminal)

`keybindings.json` locations:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/keybindings.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Code/User/keybindings.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Code\\User\\keybindings.json`

Add to `keybindings.json` to enable `Shift+Enter` for multi-line input:

```json
{
  "key": "shift+enter",
  "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
  "args": { "text": "\u001b[13;2u" },
  "when": "terminalFocus"
}
```

## Windows Terminal

Add to `settings.json` (Ctrl+Shift+, or Settings → Open JSON file) to forward the modified Enter keys OMK uses:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "command": { "action": "sendInput", "input": "\u001b[13;2u" },
      "keys": "shift+enter"
    },
    {
      "command": { "action": "sendInput", "input": "\u001b[13;3u" },
      "keys": "alt+enter"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `Shift+Enter` inserts a new line.
- Windows Terminal binds `Alt+Enter` to fullscreen by default. That prevents OMK from receiving `Alt+Enter` for follow-up queueing.
- Remapping `Alt+Enter` to `sendInput` forwards the real key chord to OMK instead.

If you already have an `actions` array, add the objects to it. If the old fullscreen behavior persists, fully close and reopen Windows Terminal.

## xfce4-terminal, terminator

These terminals have limited escape sequence support. Modified Enter keys like `Ctrl+Enter` and `Shift+Enter` cannot be distinguished from plain `Enter`, preventing custom keybindings such as `submit: ["ctrl+enter"]` from working.

For the best experience, use a terminal that supports the Kitty keyboard protocol:
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
- [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) (requires compilation with Kitty protocol support)

## IntelliJ IDEA (Integrated Terminal)

The built-in terminal has limited escape sequence support. Shift+Enter cannot be distinguished from Enter in IntelliJ's terminal.

If you want the hardware cursor visible, set `OMK_HARDWARE_CURSOR=1` before running OMK (disabled by default for compatibility).

Consider using a dedicated terminal emulator for the best experience.
