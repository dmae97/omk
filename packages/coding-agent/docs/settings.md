# Settings

OMK uses JSON settings files with project settings overriding global settings, except settings explicitly marked global-only.

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `~/.omk/agent/settings.json` | Global (all projects) |
| `.omk/settings.json` | Project (current directory) |

Edit directly or use `/settings` for common options.

## All Settings

### Model & Thinking

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `defaultProvider` | string | - | Default provider (e.g., `"anthropic"`, `"openai"`) |
| `defaultModel` | string | - | Default model ID |
| `defaultThinkingLevel` | string | - | `"off"`, `"minimal"`, `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`, `"xhigh"`, `"max"`, `"ultra"` |
| `hideThinkingBlock` | boolean | `false` | Hide thinking blocks in output |
| `thinkingBudgets` | object | - | Custom token budgets per thinking level |
| `reasoningRouterLearning` | object | - | Opt-in v4 router learning bias (global settings file only) |
| `adaptorchBridge` | object | - | Opt-in AdaptOrch advisory bridge for the auto thinking-level resolver (global settings file only) |

#### thinkingBudgets

```json
{
  "thinkingBudgets": {
    "minimal": 1024,
    "low": 4096,
    "medium": 10240,
    "high": 32768
  }
}
```

#### reasoningRouterLearning

```json
{
  "reasoningRouterLearning": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

This opt-in remains global-only, but its default data is isolated per repository or git worktree under `~/.omk/agent/router-feedback/repositories/<opaque-scope>/`. The scope is derived from the canonical worktree root and never stores the raw path. Set `biasSnapshotPath` or `feedbackLedgerPath` only when intentionally overriding that isolation with fixed paths.

#### adaptorchBridge

Global-only, default-off lifecycle for a future v4 advisory source. The timeout, TTL, consult-budget, and circuit-breaker controls are wired, but the current transport is a no-op and cannot change the resolved level. A project-scope `.omk/settings.json` value is ignored by design.

```json
{
  "adaptorchBridge": {
    "enabled": false,
    "ttlMs": 300000,
    "timeoutMs": 1500,
    "maxConsultsPerSession": 5,
    "failureThreshold": 3
  }
}
```

### UI & Display

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `theme` | string | detected | Theme name (built-in such as `"omk-paper-dark"`, `"omk-paper-light"`, `"dark"`, `"light"`, or custom). Unset: `omk-paper-dark` on dark terminals, `omk-paper-light` on light ones |
| `quietStartup` | boolean | `false` | Hide startup header |
| `collapseChangelog` | boolean | `true` | Show condensed changelog after updates (set `false` for the full "What's New" block) |
| `footerSystemMetrics` | boolean | `false` | Show system-wide CPU/MEM usage in the footer stats line |
| `enableInstallTelemetry` | boolean | `true` | Send an anonymous install/update version ping after first install or changelog-detected updates. This does not control update checks |
| `doubleEscapeAction` | string | `"tree"` | Action for double-escape: `"tree"`, `"fork"`, or `"none"` |
| `treeFilterMode` | string | `"default"` | Default filter for `/tree`: `"default"`, `"no-tools"`, `"user-only"`, `"labeled-only"`, `"all"` |
| `editorPaddingX` | number | `0` | Horizontal padding for input editor (0-3) |
| `autocompleteMaxVisible` | number | `5` | Max visible items in autocomplete dropdown (3-20) |
| `showHardwareCursor` | boolean | `false` | Show the terminal cursor while TUI positions it for IME support |
| `pinStatusSidebar` | boolean | `false` | Pin the bottom status bar as a responsive right rail (opencode-style): width scales with the terminal (~26%, 34–48 cols), the MCP roster grows on taller terminals, and the content column shrinks to match so the prompt is never covered. The rail shows only when the terminal has at least 120 columns and 16 rows; otherwise the bottom status bar is used. Toggle anytime with `Ctrl+Q`; pinning on a smaller terminal shows a status line with those minimums. Also enabled by `OMK_PIN_STATUS_SIDEBAR=1` |

### Telemetry and update checks

`enableInstallTelemetry` only controls the anonymous install/update ping to `the OMK install telemetry endpoint`. Opting out of telemetry does not disable update checks; OMK can still fetch `the OMK latest-version endpoint` to look for the latest version.

Set `OMK_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1` to disable the OMK version update check. Use `--offline` or `OMK_OFFLINE=1` to disable all startup network operations described here, including update checks, package update checks, and install/update telemetry.

### Warnings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `warnings.anthropicExtraUsage` | boolean | `true` | Show a warning when Anthropic subscription auth may use paid extra usage |

```json
{
  "warnings": {
    "anthropicExtraUsage": false
  }
}
```

### Compaction

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `compaction.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable auto-compaction |
| `compaction.model` | string | session model | Authenticated canonical `provider/model` used only for compaction |
| `compaction.reserveTokens` | number | `16384` | Legacy/default output reserve (tokens reserved for the LLM response) |
| `compaction.reservedOutputTokens` | number | `reserveTokens` | Optional override for output-only reserve |
| `compaction.reservedToolResultTokens` | number | `0` | Reserve tokens for pending tool results |
| `compaction.safetyMarginTokens` | number | `0` | Extra safety margin added to the reserve |
| `compaction.imageReserveTokens` | number | `0` | Reserve tokens for image content |
| `compaction.keepRecentTokens` | number | `20000` | Recent tokens to keep (not summarized) |
| `compaction.maxUsageRatio` | number | `0.9` | Normal trigger ratio (fraction of context window) |
| `compaction.rearmRatio` | number | `0.75 × maxUsageRatio` | Ratio below which a triggered compaction can rearm |
| `compaction.emergencyRatio` | number | `0.98` | Emergency compaction ratio |

All numeric token reserves must be non-negative safe integers. Ratios must be finite and in `(0, 1]`. Invalid values fail session creation instead of silently weakening the policy.

```json
{
  "compaction": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "zai/glm-5.2",
    "reserveTokens": 16384,
    "reservedToolResultTokens": 8192,
    "safetyMarginTokens": 1024,
    "keepRecentTokens": 20000,
    "maxUsageRatio": 0.9,
    "rearmRatio": 0.7,
    "emergencyRatio": 0.98
  }
}
```

### Context Budget

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `contextBudget.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Globally enable prompt resource budgeting; representation entries persist per workspace by default while plan entries stay in session memory |
| `contextBudget.openwiki` | boolean | `false` | Offer the workspace's `openwiki/` pages as budget candidates, ranked against each turn's query. Requires `contextBudget.enabled` |

```json
{
  "contextBudget": { "enabled": true, "openwiki": true }
}
```

This setting is global-only: `.omk/settings.json` cannot enable or disable it. Use `OMK_CONTEXT_GOVERNOR=1` to force it on for one process or `OMK_CONTEXT_GOVERNOR=0` to force it off for a baseline run. When enabled, content-addressed representation and negative-result entries persist under `.omk/cache/context-budget-v2`; plan entries stay in session memory. Set `OMK_CONTEXT_GOVERNOR_CACHE=memory` to keep every entry in session memory or `OMK_CONTEXT_GOVERNOR_CACHE_DIR` to relocate the representation snapshot.

#### Repository wiki retrieval

`contextBudget.openwiki` lets a generated [`openwiki/`](https://github.com/dmae97/omk/blob/main/README.md#repository-understanding) corpus take part in prompt budgeting. The corpus is loaded once per session and never enters the prompt directly: each page becomes a low-priority `evidence` candidate that the governor ranks against the turn's query, so pages compete for leftover budget and can never displace instructions or skills.

A corpus is admitted only on the same terms `scripts/check-openwiki.mjs` applies, because generated prose about a repository is exactly the kind of content that is expensive to be wrong about:

| Generator state | Result |
|---|---|
| `complete`, generated at the current `HEAD` | Page titles, declared symbols, and bounded page text are all offered |
| `complete`, but `HEAD` has moved | Titles and symbols only. Page text is withheld, and entries are marked stale |
| `interrupted`, with `openwiki/.manual-review.json` bound to the exact corpus digest | Treated as complete |
| `interrupted` without that review, unknown status, missing `gitHead`, or unreadable state | Refused; no page reaches the prompt |

A corpus over 200 pages or 4 MiB is refused rather than truncated, so the runtime and the gate always agree on the digest of the same directory. Symlinked pages are skipped. Source code and tests stay authoritative over every page; the pages are leads to verify, not claims to repeat.

### Agent Tool Execution

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `agent.toolScheduler` | string | `"dag-v2"` | Deterministic resource-claim scheduler. Use `"waves-v1"` for compatibility rollback |
| `agent.maxToolConcurrency` | number | `4` | Maximum calls in one DAG level; `0` removes the cap |
| `agent.toolTimeoutMs` | number | `0` | Fallback tool execution timeout in milliseconds; `0` disables the fallback timer |
| `agent.toolTimeouts` | object | built-in defaults | Per-tool-name timeout overrides; `0` disables that tool's timer |

Built-in defaults are 30 seconds for `read`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`; 60 seconds for `edit` and `write`; and 300 seconds for `bash`. Explicit `agent.toolTimeouts` entries override these defaults. Extension tools may override settings per call with `resolveTimeoutMs(ctx)`; otherwise custom tools without a per-name value use `agent.toolTimeoutMs`. Timeout values must be integer milliseconds from `0` through `2147483647`.

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "toolScheduler": "dag-v2",
    "maxToolConcurrency": 4,
    "toolTimeoutMs": 0,
    "toolTimeouts": {
      "read": 30000,
      "write": 60000,
      "bash": 300000,
      "my_mcp_tool": 120000,
      "my_browser_tool": 180000
    }
  }
}
```

`OMK_TOOL_SCHEDULER` overrides the file setting for one process. Set it to `waves-v1` for rollback or `dag-v2` to force the resource DAG. Invalid scheduler and timeout values fail session creation instead of silently weakening the policy.

The DAG preserves source-order result artifacts. `bash`, unknown tools, and extension tools without explicit resource claims remain exclusive. Tool timeout is logical cancellation: OMK closes the tool call and signals cancellation, but arbitrary JavaScript or external side effects may continue if the tool ignores that signal.

### Resource Governor

The governor probes host capacity (memory, workspace disk, V8 heap, system CPU) and evaluates a resource admission decision, surfaced through `/resource [probe|policy]` in the TUI and `omk doctor resources [--json]` headless. `omk doctor resources --report [--json]` aggregates bounded, identifier-free admission counts from local run journals without probing the current host. Only reason-qualified records count toward the 30-record floor; legacy/malformed reason coverage remains diagnostic. The floor is only a sample signal, always requires human review, and never promotes the mode. In `observe` mode (default) it records decisions without changing behavior; in `adaptive`/`strict` modes each top-level prompt runs a bounded preflight probe and throttles the effective tool concurrency for that run (never above `agent.maxToolConcurrency`), restoring it when the run settles. Heavy-process caps are enforced at the governed bash boundary; the internal subagent-lane launcher is not wired into live child dispatch. Absent settings keep prior behavior unchanged.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `resourceGovernor.enabled` | boolean | `true` | `false` forces mode `off` |
| `resourceGovernor.mode` | string | `"observe"` | `off` (disabled), `observe` (record only), `adaptive`/`strict` (throttle per-run tool concurrency under pressure) |
| `resourceGovernor.maxProbeMs` | number | `300` | Async probe deadline in ms; valid `50..5000` |
| `resourceGovernor.cpuSampleMs` | number | `180` | CPU two-sample interval in ms; valid `150..250` |
| `resourceGovernor.constrainedAvailableMemoryMiB` | number | `1536` | Below this effective available memory the host is `constrained` |
| `resourceGovernor.criticalAvailableMemoryMiB` | number | `512` | Below this it is `critical`; must be `<=` the constrained threshold |
| `resourceGovernor.constrainedDiskFreeMiB` | number | `4096` | Workspace free-disk threshold for `constrained` |
| `resourceGovernor.criticalDiskFreeMiB` | number | `1024` | Workspace free-disk threshold for `critical` |
| `resourceGovernor.constrainedHeapRatio` | number | `0.75` | V8 heap used/limit ratio for `constrained` |
| `resourceGovernor.criticalHeapRatio` | number | `0.85` | V8 heap ratio for `critical` |
| `resourceGovernor.busyCpuPercent` | number | `85` | System CPU percent that throttles; CPU alone never reports `critical` |
| `resourceGovernor.normalMaxToolConcurrency` | number | `4` | Admission tool cap at `normal` pressure |
| `resourceGovernor.constrainedMaxToolConcurrency` | number | `2` | Admission tool cap at `constrained` pressure |
| `resourceGovernor.criticalMaxToolConcurrency` | number | `1` | Admission tool cap at `critical` pressure |
| `resourceGovernor.normalMaxParallelLanes` | number | `4` | Subagent lane cap at `normal` |
| `resourceGovernor.constrainedMaxParallelLanes` | number | `2` | Subagent lane cap at `constrained` |
| `resourceGovernor.criticalMaxParallelLanes` | number | `1` | Subagent lane cap at `critical` |
| `resourceGovernor.normalMaxHeavyProcesses` | number | `2` | Heavy process cap at `normal` |
| `resourceGovernor.constrainedMaxHeavyProcesses` | number | `1` | Heavy process cap at `constrained` |
| `resourceGovernor.criticalMaxHeavyProcesses` | number | `1` | Heavy process cap at `critical` |

Validation is explicit and fail-closed: invalid values are reported (in `/resource policy` and `omk doctor resources --json` under `settingsErrors`) and the defaults apply for the failed area. Caps must satisfy `normal >= constrained >= critical` and stay within `1..64`; critical thresholds must not exceed constrained ones. Admission caps never raise user-configured caps (`agent.maxToolConcurrency` keeps precedence; `0` "unlimited" is limited to the admission cap in `adaptive` and `strict` modes).

`OMK_RESOURCE_GOVERNOR=off|observe|adaptive|strict` overrides the mode for one process, e.g. `OMK_RESOURCE_GOVERNOR=off omk` as a rollback switch.

### Completion Sound

Plays a short system sound only after the top-level prompt settles: retries, continuations, and tools must be drained first. Current subagent work is awaited inside its tool call, so that tool boundary also covers those children. The settlement contract reserves direct child/shard counters for future live wiring; those paths must connect the counters before activation. Sound is enabled by default only in the interactive TUI on a real TTY—never in RPC, JSON, print mode, or CI. Successful prompts honor `minDurationMs`; failed and aborted prompts notify immediately. Backends use fixed absolute executables and arguments (macOS `afplay`, Windows system PowerShell, Linux `canberra-gtk-play`/`paplay`/`aplay`), an allowlisted environment with no inherited `PATH` or credentials, and the OS temporary directory as cwd. WSL uses terminal BEL because Windows executable mounts have no fixed trusted path. Sound failures are diagnostics only and never affect the prompt outcome.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `notifications.completionSound.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Master switch; `OMK_COMPLETION_SOUND=0` disables and `=1` enables it for one process |
| `notifications.completionSound.minDurationMs` | number | `5000` | Minimum duration for successful-completion sounds; failed/aborted outcomes bypass it |
| `notifications.completionSound.onSuccess` | boolean | `true` | Notify after a completed prompt that meets the duration floor |
| `notifications.completionSound.onFailure` | boolean | `true` | Notify immediately after a failed terminal outcome |
| `notifications.completionSound.onAbort` | boolean | `true` | Notify immediately after an aborted/stopped terminal outcome |
| `notifications.completionSound.terminalBellFallback` | boolean | `true` | Fall back to terminal BEL when no sound backend works |

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "completionSound": { "minDurationMs": 10000, "onAbort": false }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "resourceGovernor": {
    "mode": "observe",
    "constrainedAvailableMemoryMiB": 2048,
    "criticalAvailableMemoryMiB": 512
  }
}
```

### Branch Summary

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `branchSummary.reserveTokens` | number | `16384` | Tokens reserved for branch summarization |
| `branchSummary.skipPrompt` | boolean | `false` | Skip "Summarize branch?" prompt on `/tree` navigation (defaults to no summary) |

### Retry

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `retry.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable automatic agent-level retry on transient errors |
| `retry.maxRetries` | number | `3` | Maximum agent-level retry attempts |
| `retry.baseDelayMs` | number | `2000` | Base delay for agent-level exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s) |
| `retry.provider.timeoutMs` | number | SDK default | Provider/SDK request timeout in milliseconds. Also bounds how long the `openai-codex` SSE transport waits for response headers (floor 10s); large contexts need more than the floor |
| `retry.provider.maxRetries` | number | `0` | Provider/SDK retry attempts |
| `retry.provider.maxRetryDelayMs` | number | `60000` | Max server-requested delay before failing (60s) |

When a provider requests a retry delay longer than `retry.provider.maxRetryDelayMs` (e.g., Google's "quota will reset after 5h"), the request fails immediately with an informative error instead of waiting silently. Set to `0` to disable the cap.

Keep `retry.provider.maxRetries` at `0` unless provider-level retries are explicitly needed. Setting it above `0` can make SDK/provider retries handle out-of-usage-limit errors before OMK sees them, which may block the agent until the provider quota resets in some circumstances.

At the agent level, recognized quota and billing-cycle failures are retryable so OMK can first switch to an authenticated `providerResilience.failoverCandidates` entry. If no candidate qualifies, normal retry backoff applies. See [Provider Resilience](provider-resilience.md).

```json
{
  "retry": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "baseDelayMs": 2000,
    "provider": {
      "timeoutMs": 3600000,
      "maxRetries": 0,
      "maxRetryDelayMs": 60000
    }
  }
}
```

### Message Delivery

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `steeringMode` | string | `"one-at-a-time"` | How steering messages are sent: `"all"` or `"one-at-a-time"` |
| `followUpMode` | string | `"one-at-a-time"` | How follow-up messages are sent: `"all"` or `"one-at-a-time"` |
| `transport` | string | `"auto"` | Preferred transport for providers that support multiple transports: `"sse"`, `"websocket"`, `"websocket-cached"`, or `"auto"` |
| `httpIdleTimeoutMs` | number | `300000` | HTTP header/body idle timeout in milliseconds, also used by providers with explicit stream idle timeouts. Set to `0` to disable. |
| `websocketConnectTimeoutMs` | number | `15000` | WebSocket connect/open handshake timeout in milliseconds for providers that support WebSocket transports. Set to `0` to disable. |

### Terminal & Images

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `terminal.showImages` | boolean | `true` | Show images in terminal (if supported) |
| `terminal.imageWidthCells` | number | `60` | Preferred inline image width in terminal cells |
| `terminal.clearOnShrink` | boolean | `false` | Clear empty rows when content shrinks (can cause flicker) |
| `images.autoResize` | boolean | `true` | Resize images to 2000x2000 max |
| `images.blockImages` | boolean | `false` | Block all images from being sent to LLM |

### Shell

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `shellPath` | string | - | Custom shell path (e.g., for Cygwin on Windows) |
| `shellCommandPrefix` | string | - | Prefix for every bash command (e.g., `"shopt -s expand_aliases"`) |
| `npmCommand` | string[] | - | Command argv used for npm package lookup/install operations (e.g., `["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]`) |

```json
{
  "npmCommand": ["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]
}
```

`npmCommand` is used for all npm package-manager operations, including installs, uninstalls, and dependency installs inside git packages. User-scoped npm packages install under `~/.omk/agent/npm/`; project-scoped npm packages install under `.omk/npm/`. Use argv-style entries exactly as the process should be launched. When `npmCommand` is configured, git package dependency installs use plain `install` to avoid npm-specific flags in wrappers or alternate package managers.

### Sessions

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `sessionDir` | string | - | Directory where session files are stored. Accepts absolute or relative paths, plus `~`. |

```json
{ "sessionDir": ".omk/sessions" }
```

When multiple sources specify a session directory, precedence is `--session-dir`, `OMK_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`, then `sessionDir` in settings.json.

### Model Cycling

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabledModels` | string[] | - | Model patterns for Ctrl+P cycling (same format as `--models` CLI flag) |

```json
{
  "enabledModels": ["claude-*", "gpt-4o", "gemini-2*"]
}
```

### Markdown

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `markdown.codeBlockIndent` | string | `"  "` | Indentation for code blocks |

### Resources

These settings define where to load extensions, skills, prompts, and themes from.

Paths in `~/.omk/agent/settings.json` resolve relative to `~/.omk/agent`. Paths in `.omk/settings.json` resolve relative to `.omk`. Absolute paths and `~` are supported.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| `packages` | array | `[]` | npm/git packages to load resources from |
| `extensions` | string[] | `[]` | Local extension file paths or directories |
| `skills` | string[] | `[]` | Local skill file paths or directories |
| `defaultActiveSkills` | string[] | `[]` | Global-only list of up to 64 exact user-scoped skill names marked active in every prompt; full instructions remain on-demand |
| `prompts` | string[] | `[]` | Local prompt template paths or directories |
| `themes` | string[] | `[]` | Local theme file paths or directories |
| `enableSkillCommands` | boolean | `true` | Register skills as `/skill:name` commands |

Resource path arrays (`extensions`, `skills`, `prompts`, and `themes`) support glob patterns and exclusions. Use `!pattern` to exclude, `+path` to force-include an exact path, and `-path` to force-exclude one. `defaultActiveSkills` accepts exact names only.

#### packages

String form loads all resources from a package:

```json
{
  "packages": ["omk-skills", "@org/my-extension"]
}
```

Object form filters which resources to load:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "source": "omk-skills",
      "skills": ["brave-search", "transcribe"],
      "extensions": []
    }
  ]
}
```

See [packages.md](packages.md) for package management details.

## Example

```json
{
  "defaultProvider": "anthropic",
  "defaultModel": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "defaultThinkingLevel": "medium",
  "theme": "dark",
  "compaction": {
    "enabled": true,
    "reserveTokens": 16384,
    "keepRecentTokens": 20000
  },
  "contextBudget": { "enabled": true },
  "retry": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxRetries": 3
  },
  "enabledModels": ["claude-*", "gpt-4o"],
  "warnings": {
    "anthropicExtraUsage": true
  },
  "packages": ["omk-skills"]
}
```

## Project Overrides

Project settings (`.omk/settings.json`) override global settings. Nested objects are merged. Settings marked global-only, including `contextBudget` and `defaultActiveSkills`, are read from global settings only.

```json
// ~/.omk/agent/settings.json (global)
{
  "theme": "dark",
  "compaction": { "enabled": true, "reserveTokens": 16384 }
}

// .omk/settings.json (project)
{
  "compaction": { "reserveTokens": 8192 }
}

// Result
{
  "theme": "dark",
  "compaction": { "enabled": true, "reserveTokens": 8192 }
}
```
