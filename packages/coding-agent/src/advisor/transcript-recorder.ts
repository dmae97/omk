 * Append-only persister for an advisor agent's transcript.

 * The advisor is a passive reviewer with its own model usage, so — like a task
 * subagent — its turns are written to a JSONL inside the owning session's
 * artifacts dir (`<session>/__advisor.jsonl`, `<session>/<SubId>/__advisor.jsonl`
 * for subagent advisors). That single file gives the advisor model proper usage
 * attribution in `omp stats` (the stats parser scans the session dir
 * recursively) and a read-only transcript in the Agent Hub, without making the
 * advisor a registered, messageable peer.
 *
 * The target is derived from the *session file* (`getSessionFile()`), never
 * `getArtifactsDir()` — subagents adopt the parent's artifact manager, so the
 * artifacts dir points at the parent root and every subagent advisor would
 * collide. The file path is resolved synchronously when a message finalizes and
 * captured for the queued write, so a `/new`, resume, or session switch in
 * flight can never misattribute an old advisor turn into the new session's file.
 * On such a switch the previous writer is closed and the new file opened on the
 * next recorded turn. The recorder never truncates: the advisor's in-memory
 * context resets/compacts independently, but every billed turn is appended here.
