Asks user when you need clarification or input during task execution.

<conditions>
- Multiple approaches exist with significantly different tradeoffs user should weigh
</conditions>

<instruction>
- Use `recommended: <index>` to mark default (0-indexed); " (Recommended)" added automatically
- Use `questions` for multiple related questions instead of asking one at a time
- Set `multi: true` on question to allow multiple selections
- `ask.timeout` only applies while choosing options; once the user selects "Other (type your own)", there is no timeout
</instruction>

<caution>
- Provide 2-5 concise, distinct options
</caution>

<critical>
- **Default to action.** Resolve ambiguity yourself using repo conventions, existing patterns, and reasonable defaults. Exhaust existing sources (code, configs, docs, history) before asking. Only ask when options have materially different tradeoffs the user must decide.
- **If multiple choices are acceptable**, pick the most conservative/standard option and proceed; state the choice.
- **Do NOT include "Other" option** — UI automatically adds "Other (type your own)" to every question.
