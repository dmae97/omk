Edits files by addressing syntax-aware chunks from `read` output.

Read the file first with `read(path="file.ts")`. Use chunk paths exactly as shown by the latest `read` result. {{#if chunkSplices}}For `replace`, `delete`, and `splice`, supply{{else}}For `replace` and `delete`, supply{{/if}} the chunk checksum separately as `crc`.

Successful edit responses already include the updated root chunk rendering for that file. Do not immediately re-read the file just to refresh checksums unless the file may have changed externally.

**Checksum scope:** Each chunk has its own CRC over that chunk’s source span. Editing non-overlapping lines elsewhere in the file does not change unrelated chunks’ checksums. There is no separate whole-file guard.

<operations>
{{#if chunkSplices}}
**Choosing the right operation:**
- To fix a single line → `splice` with `beg`=`end`=that line number
- To fix a contiguous range of lines → `splice` with `beg`=first line, `end`=last line
- To rewrite an entire function/method from scratch → `replace` (without `beg`/`end`)
- `splice` is almost always the right choice for small, targeted fixes
- `replace` with `beg`/`end` also works for line-level fixes (same behavior as `splice`)

{{/if}}
|op|effect|
|---|---|
|`append_child`|insert as last child inside a container (before closing delimiter)|
|`prepend_child`|insert as first child inside a container (after opening delimiter)|
|`append_sibling`|insert after the selected chunk|
|`prepend_sibling`|insert before the selected chunk|
|`replace`|without `beg`/`end`: rewrite the **entire** chunk from first line to last line; supply full replacement content. With `beg`/`end`: replace only those **file lines** within the chunk (same as `splice` but semantically a replacement). `splice` is almost always the right choice for small, targeted fixes|
|`delete`|remove the entire chunk|
{{#if chunkSplices}}
|`splice`|when `beg` ≤ `end`, replace **file** lines `beg`–`end` (inclusive) within the selected chunk; empty `content` deletes them. When `beg` = `end` + 1, **zero-width splice**: insert in the gap after file line `end` and before file line `beg` (no lines removed)|
{{/if}}
- `op` is a single keyword only (e.g. `"splice"`). Do not put other fields like `sel` inside `op`.
- `sel` is the chunk path (a separate field from `op`)
- `crc` is the chunk checksum used for staleness validation on `replace`, `delete`{{#if chunkSplices}}, and `splice`{{/if}}; it guards the selected chunk, not unrelated file changes elsewhere in the file
{{#if chunkSplices}}
- `beg`/`end` are **absolute file line numbers** (same as the gutter in `read`). They must fall within the selected chunk’s file line span (or form a valid zero-width gap on its boundary).
{{/if}}
- `path="file.ts:chunk_path"` sets a default `sel` for operations that omit it
- top-level `crc` sets the default checksum for the path-level selector
- **Auto-indent (flat):** The tool adds the target insertion column’s base indent to every **non-empty** line of your `content`. It does not parse or understand block nesting; put any deeper relative indentation in the `content` yourself (extra leading spaces/tabs on inner lines).
- Chunk paths are always fully qualified: `class_Server.fn_start`, not bare `fn_start`
- Batch ops observe earlier edits in the same request. If op 1 changes a chunk’s checksum, span, or path, op 2 must use the **post-op-1** checksum/span/path.
- `replace`/`delete` operate on the selected chunk range, including leading comments or attributes that the parser attached to that chunk.
</operations>

{{#if chunkSplices}}
<splice>
**Zero-width `splice` (insert only, `beg` = `end` + 1), using file line numbers `S` = chunk’s first line, `E` = chunk’s last line:**

Use zero-width splice for separator gaps between neighboring chunks. Gap edits are independent from either chunk’s checksum: inserting into the gap does not update the following chunk’s `crc`, and later `replace`/`delete` operations only affect that chunk’s own selected range.

|Goal|`beg`|`end`|
|---|---|---|
|Insert before file line L|L|L − 1|
|Insert after file line L|L + 1|L|
|Insert before the chunk’s first line S|S|S − 1|
|Insert after the chunk’s last line E|E + 1|E|
</splice>

<critical>
- You **MUST** always include `path` in every edit call.
- You **MUST** read the latest chunk output before editing.
- You **MUST** provide `crc` for `replace`, `delete`{{#if chunkSplices}}, and `splice`{{/if}}.
- You **MUST** use the updated root chunk output from the edit response for follow-up edits in the same file when possible.
- You **MUST** use the smallest correct chunk; do not rewrite siblings unnecessarily.
- You **MUST NOT** invent chunk paths. Read the current listing first and copy the actual path names, including `fn_*` prefixes as shown. Chunk nesting uses `.`.
{{#if chunkSplices}}
- For `splice`, copy `beg`/`end` from the **file line numbers** in `read` output (the same values as elision `sel=L…` ranges).
- **Do NOT batch multiple `splice` operations on the same chunk** in one edit call. Each splice changes the chunk's checksum, and you cannot predict the new checksum. Instead: either combine the changes into a single splice with a wider `beg`/`end` range covering all affected lines, or make separate edit calls (one splice per call).
- Each `splice` operation requires its own `crc` field (not just a top-level `crc`). Put `"crc": "XXXX"` inside the operation object.
{{/if}}
- When restoring a deleted statement, check surrounding lines carefully — insert at the exact position relative to existing code. Do not duplicate adjacent lines.
- Use only chunk paths that appear in the `read` output. If you need deeper chunks, `read` the parent chunk first to discover its children.
