Your patch language is a compact, line-anchored edit format.

A patch contains one or more file sections. The first non-blank line of every section **MUST** be `---PATH`.
A "Lid" is a per-line anchor emitted by `read`, `grep`, etc. — `<lineNumber><2-letter-hash>`, e.g. `5th`, `123ab`. You **MUST** copy a Lid verbatim from the latest output for the file you're editing.

This format is purely textual. The tool has NO awareness of language, indentation, brackets, fences, or table widths. You are responsible for emitting valid syntax in your replacements/insertions.

<ops>
---PATH    start a section editing PATH; cursor begins at EOF
^          move cursor to BOF (before line 1)
$          move cursor to EOF (after the last line)
@Lid       move cursor to AFTER the anchored line (does not modify the file)
^Lid       move cursor to BEFORE the anchored line (does not modify the file)
+TEXT      insert one line containing TEXT at the cursor
+          insert one blank line at the cursor
Lid=TEXT   replace the anchored line with TEXT
LidA..LidB=TEXT replace the range with one line; following `\TEXT` lines append literal lines to the replacement
\TEXT      append literal TEXT to the active range replacement
\          append a blank line to the active range replacement
Lid=       blank the anchored line's content but KEEP the line (results in an empty line, NOT a removed line; use `-Lid` to remove)
-Lid       delete the anchored line (repeat for multi-line delete)
-LidA..LidB delete the contiguous line range LidA..LidB (inclusive)
!rm        delete the section's PATH (**MUST** be the only op in the section)
!mv DEST   rename the section's PATH to DEST (**MUST** be the only op in the section)
</ops>

<rules>
- Cursor-only ops (`^`, `$`, `@Lid`, `^Lid`) reposition without modifying. To insert anything you **MUST** follow them with `+TEXT` (or `+` for a blank).
- TEXT in `+TEXT`, `Lid=TEXT`, and `\TEXT` is literal line content, INCLUDING leading whitespace. You **MUST NOT** trim or re-indent it.
- Consecutive `+TEXT` ops produce consecutive lines in the order written. You **MUST NOT** separate them with a stray `+` unless you intend to insert a blank line.
- `Lid=TEXT` rewrites ONE line. To rewrite K adjacent lines, you **MUST** use `LidA..LidB=FIRST_LINE` followed immediately by `\NEXT_LINE` continuation lines. You **MUST** use bare `\` for blank replacement lines.
- You **MUST** prefix every range-replacement continuation line with `\`, especially when the replacement line starts with edit syntax characters such as `#`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `$`, `^`, `!`, or a Lid-shaped token.
- `\TEXT` **MUST** appear only immediately after an active range replacement block. It **MUST NOT** be used as a general insert operator.
- The legacy `-LidA..LidB` + `+TEXT…` block-rewrite form also works.
- To insert ABOVE a line, you **MUST** use `^Lid` then `+TEXT`. To insert above line 1, you **MUST** use `^` (BOF) then `+TEXT`. To insert below a line, you **MUST** use `@Lid` then `+TEXT`.
- Multiple `---PATH` sections **MAY** appear in one input; each section is applied in order.
- `!rm` / `!mv DEST` **MUST NOT** be combined with line edits in the same section.
- Lids contain a content hash. If a line has changed since you read it, the tool rejects the edit and shows the current content; you **MUST** re-read and retry with fresh Lids. Small drift (≤5 lines) where the original hash still matches a nearby line auto-rebases with a warning; larger shifts require a re-read.
- After `+TEXT` (or `+`) the cursor advances past the inserted line, so consecutive `+TEXT` ops stack in order. After `Lid=TEXT` the cursor sits on the modified anchor; after `-Lid` it sits on the slot the deleted line vacated. You **MUST** use a fresh `@Lid` / `^Lid` / `^` / `$` to reposition.
- The tool is syntax-blind: it will not check brackets, indentation, table column counts, or fence integrity. You **MUST** verify indentation-sensitive or structured files after editing (Python, Markdown tables/fences).
- A section whose PATH does not yet exist creates the file from your `+TEXT` lines (use `^` or `$` then `+TEXT…`). No separate "create file" op is needed.

<critical>
- You **MUST** copy Lids EXACTLY from the latest read/grep output. You **MUST NOT** guess, shorten, drop letters, or invent line numbers.
- Current/added preview lines include fresh `LINE+hash|content` anchors. Removed preview lines show deleted content and **MUST NOT** be reused as anchors.
- You **MUST** emit only lines that change. You **MUST NOT** echo unchanged context; the anchor implies position.
- You **MUST NOT** write `Lid=<sameTextThatIsAlreadyOnThatLine>`; the tool reports a no-op (no change applied). Emit `Lid=TEXT` only when TEXT differs.
- TEXT after `=`, `+`, or `\` includes leading whitespace verbatim. You **MUST NOT** trim or re-indent it.
- This is NOT unified diff. You **MUST NOT** write `@@` headers, `-OLD`/`+NEW` pairs, context lines, or `+Lid|…` (bad: `+5th|new text`; good: `5th=new text`).
- You **MUST NOT** split `Lid=TEXT` across two physical lines.
- For a contiguous range replacement, you **MUST** use `LidA..LidB=FIRST_LINE` followed by `\NEXT_LINE` continuation lines, or use `-LidA..LidB` + `+TEXT…` (delete + insert).
- The tool is syntax-blind. Indentation, brackets, fences, table widths — you remain responsible.
