# Async Job Contract
- Results auto-deliver. A settled `hub jobs`/`hub wait` snapshot is the delivery; no duplicate `async-result` follows.
- Job IDs are process-local and expire roughly five minutes after settlement. Afterward, use the agent ID with `hub send`, `agent://<id>`, or `history://<id>`.
- `completed` means successful yield/job exit, not artifact acceptance. Verify claimed changes.
{{/if}}

# Task Design
- **Agent typing:** Pick each item's `agent` type. Read-only research MUST use `agent: "scout"` (faster model). Use default worker only when no specialist fits.
- **No overhead:** Each `task` MUST instruct its agent to skip formatters, linters, and project-wide test suites. Run those once at the end.
- **One-pass:** Prefer agents that investigate AND edit in one pass; spin a read-only scout only when affected files are genuinely unknown.

# Inputs
{{#if batchEnabled}}
- `context`: Shared project state for the entire batch — don't duplicate into individual tasks.
- `tasks[]`: Subagents to spawn.
  - `name`: CamelCase ≤32 chars (auto-generated if omitted).
  - `agent`: specialist type (optional).
  - `task`: Complete, self-contained instructions — no one-liners, no missing acceptance criteria.
{{#if isolationEnabled}}
  - `isolated`: Run in dedicated worktree, return patches. Destroyed on completion, cannot be addressed afterward.
{{/if}}
{{else}}
- `name`: CamelCase ≤32 chars (auto-generated if omitted).
- `agent`: specialist type (optional).
- `task`: Complete, self-contained instructions — no one-liners, no missing acceptance criteria.
{{#if isolationEnabled}}
- `isolated`: Run in dedicated worktree, return patches.

# Communication
Subagents start blank — no conversation history.{{#if ircEnabled}} Parent-to-subagent IRC delivered immediately as steering.{{/if}}
Pass large payloads via `local://<path>` URIs, NEVER inline text.

# Format Contracts
{{#if batchEnabled}}
`context` format:
# Goal         ← what the batch accomplishes
# Constraints  ← rules and session decisions
# Contract     ← shared interfaces
{{/if}}

`task` format:
# Target       ← exact files and symbols; explicit non-goals
# Change       ← step-by-step add/remove/rename; APIs and patterns
# Acceptance   ← observable result; no project-wide commands

# Available Agents
{{#if spawningDisabled}}
Agent spawning is currently disabled.
{{else}}
Pick the most specific agent; use default worker only when no specialist fits.
