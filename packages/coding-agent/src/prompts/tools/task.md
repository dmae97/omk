# Task Design
- **Agent typing:** Choose each item's `agent` type first. Read-only research MUST use `agent: "scout"`, which runs on a faster model. Use the default worker only when no listed specialist fits.
- **No overhead:** Each `task` MUST instruct its agent to skip formatters, linters, and project-wide test suites. You will run those once at the end.
- **One-pass agents:** Prefer agents that investigate **and** edit in a single pass; only spin a read-only discovery step (e.g. `agent: "scout"`) when the affected files are genuinely unknown.

# Inputs
{{#if batchEnabled}}
- `context`: Shared project state, constraints, and contracts. Applies to the entire batch; do not duplicate this background into individual tasks.
- `tasks[]`: Array of subagents to spawn.
  - `name`: A stable CamelCase identifier (≤32 chars), used to address the agent (IRC, job ids). Generated automatically if omitted.
  - `agent`: The agent type running this item (e.g. `scout`, `reviewer`). Omitting it gives you the general-purpose worker (`{{defaultAgent}}`) — NEVER pass that name explicitly. Only omit it after checking the agent list below and finding no specialist that fits.{{#if allowedAgentsText}} Current spawn policy allows: {{allowedAgentsText}}.{{/if}}
  - `task`: Complete, self-contained instructions. One-liners or missing acceptance criteria are PROHIBITED.
{{#if isolationEnabled}}
  - `isolated`: Run in a dedicated worktree and return patches. Isolated agents are destroyed upon completion and cannot be addressed afterward.

# Context and Communication
Subagents start blank. They have no access to your conversation history.
{{#if ircEnabled}}- **Steering delivery:** Parent-to-subagent IRC is delivered immediately as steering; subagents blocked in `job poll` / `irc wait` do not need to poll separately for it.{{/if}}
{{#if batchEnabled}}
- Pass large payloads using `local://<path>` URIs, NEVER inline text.
{{else}}
- Write shared project state ONCE to a `local://` file (e.g., `local://ctx.md`) and reference that URL in each `task`.
{{/if}}

# Format Contracts
{{#if batchEnabled}}
The `context` field MUST follow this format:
# Goal         ← what the batch accomplishes
# Constraints  ← rules and session decisions
# Contract     ← shared interfaces
{{/if}}

The `task` field MUST follow this format:
# Target       ← exact files and symbols; explicit non-goals
# Change       ← step-by-step add/remove/rename; APIs and patterns
# Acceptance   ← observable result; no project-wide commands

# Available Agents
{{#if spawningDisabled}}
Agent spawning is currently disabled.
{{else}}
Pick the most specific agent for each task. Use the default worker only when no specialist below fits.
