/**
 * Shard execution contract.
 *
 * These declarations describe the call the executor makes and the input it
 * takes. They lived in the executor, so the runner — which the executor calls
 * to advance one shard — had to import the executor back to name its own
 * parameter type. Moving the contract below both leaves the executor free to
 * depend on the runner without the runner depending on the executor.
 *
 * Types only. Imports stay on the plan, store, admission, and permit modules,
 * none of which reach the executor or the runner.
