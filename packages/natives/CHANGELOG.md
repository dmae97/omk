# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [9.6.2] - 2026-02-01
### Breaking Changes

- Renamed `EllipsisKind` enum to `Ellipsis`
- Changed `TextInput` type parameter to `string` in `truncateToWidth()`, `visibleWidth()`, `sliceWithWidth()`, and `extractSegments()` functions—Uint8Array is no longer accepted
- Removed `TextInput` type export from public API

### Added

- Added `visibleWidth()` function to measure the visible width of text, excluding ANSI codes

### Changed

- Reordered native module search paths to prioritize repository build artifacts
- Improved JSDoc documentation for `truncateToWidth()` with clearer parameter descriptions and behavior details
- Added early return optimization in `truncateToWidth()` to skip native call when text fits within maxWidth and padding is not requested
- Added early return optimization in `sliceWithWidth()` to return empty result when length is zero or negative

### Removed

- Removed validation checks for `PhotonImage` and `SamplingFilter` native exports
- Removed early return optimization in `truncateToWidth()` when text fits within maxWidth

## [9.6.1] - 2026-02-01
### Added

- Added `matchesKittySequence` function to match Kitty protocol sequences for codepoint and modifier

### Removed

- Removed `visibleWidth` function from text utilities

## [9.6.0] - 2026-02-01
### Added

- Support for cross-compilation via `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` environment variable
- Support for overriding platform and architecture detection via `TARGET_PLATFORM` and `TARGET_ARCH` environment variables

### Changed

- Native build script now searches for release artifacts in target-specific directories when cross-compiling

## [9.5.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- Added `sortByMtime` option to `FindOptions` to sort results by modification time (most recent first) before applying limit
- Added streaming callback support to `grep()` function via optional `onMatch` parameter for real-time match notifications
- Exported `RequestOptions` type for timeout and abort signal configuration across native APIs
- Exported `fuzzyFind` function for fuzzy file path search with gitignore support
- Exported `FuzzyFindOptions`, `FuzzyFindMatch`, and `FuzzyFindResult` types for fuzzy search API
- Added `fuzzyFind` export for fuzzy file path search with gitignore support

### Changed

- Changed `grep()` and `fuzzyFind()` to support timeout and abort signal handling via `RequestOptions`
- Updated `GrepOptions` and `FuzzyFindOptions` to extend `RequestOptions` for consistent timeout/cancellation support
- Refactored `htmlToMarkdown()` to support timeout and abort signal handling

### Removed

- Removed `grepDirect()` function (use `grep()` instead)
- Removed `grepPool()` function (use `grep()` instead)
- Removed `terminate()` export from grep module
- Removed `terminateHtmlWorker` export from html module

### Fixed

- Fixed potential crashes when updating native binaries by using safe copy strategy that avoids overwriting in-memory binaries
