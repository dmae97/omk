# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Exported `copyToClipboard()` and `readImageFromClipboard()` functions for clipboard operations
- Exported `ClipboardImage` type for clipboard image data with MIME type information
- Added `wrapTextWithAnsi()` function to wrap text to a visible width while preserving ANSI escape codes across line breaks
- Added native clipboard helpers for copying text and reading images via arboard

## [9.7.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- Exported `killTree` function to kill a process and all its descendants using platform-native APIs
- Exported `listDescendants` function to list all descendant PIDs of a process
- Added `dev:native` npm script to build debug native binaries with `--dev` flag
- Added `OMP_DEV` environment variable support for loading and debugging development native builds
- Exported keyboard parsing and matching functions: `parseKey`, `parseKittySequence`, `matchesLegacySequence`, and `matchesKey` for terminal input handling
- Exported `KeyEventType` enum and `ParsedKittyResult` type for Kitty keyboard protocol support
- Added `parseKey` function to parse terminal input and return normalized key identifiers (e.g., "ctrl+c", "shift+tab")
- Added `parseKittySequence` function to parse Kitty keyboard protocol sequences with codepoint, modifier, and event type information
- Added `matchesLegacySequence` function to match legacy escape sequences for specific keys
- Added `matchesKey` function to match input against key identifiers with support for modifiers and Kitty protocol

### Changed

- Modified native binary build process to support both debug and release builds via `--dev` flag
- Updated native binary search to prioritize platform-tagged builds and separate debug/release candidates
- Changed debug builds to output to `pi_natives.dev.node` instead of mixing with release artifacts
- Improved native binary installation to use atomic rename operations and better fallback handling for Windows DLLs
- Reordered native binary search candidates to prioritize platform-tagged builds and avoid loading stale cross-compiled binaries
- Enhanced cross-compilation detection to prevent installing wrong-platform fallback binaries during cross-compilation builds

### Fixed

- Fixed potential issue where cross-compiled binaries could overwrite platform-specific native builds with incorrect architecture binaries

## [9.6.4] - 2026-02-01
### Breaking Changes

- Changed callback signature for `find()` and `grep()` streaming callbacks to receive `(error, match)` instead of `(match)` for proper error handling

## [9.6.2] - 2026-02-01
### Breaking Changes

- Renamed `EllipsisKind` enum to `Ellipsis`
- Changed `TextInput` type parameter to `string` in `truncateToWidth()`, `visibleWidth()`, `sliceWithWidth()`, and `extractSegments()` functions—Uint8Array is no longer accepted
- Removed `TextInput` type export from public API

### Added

- Added `visibleWidth()` function to measure the visible width of text, excluding ANSI codes

### Changed

- Reordered native module search paths to prioritize repository build artifacts
- Improved JSDoc documentation for `truncateToWidth()` with clearer parameter descriptions and behavior details
- Added early return optimization in `truncateToWidth()` to skip native call when text fits within maxWidth and padding is not requested
- Added early return optimization in `sliceWithWidth()` to return empty result when length is zero or negative

### Removed

- Removed validation checks for `PhotonImage` and `SamplingFilter` native exports
- Removed early return optimization in `truncateToWidth()` when text fits within maxWidth

## [9.6.1] - 2026-02-01
### Added

- Added `matchesKittySequence` function to match Kitty protocol sequences for codepoint and modifier

### Removed

- Removed `visibleWidth` function from text utilities

## [9.6.0] - 2026-02-01
### Added

- Support for cross-compilation via `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` environment variable
- Support for overriding platform and architecture detection via `TARGET_PLATFORM` and `TARGET_ARCH` environment variables

### Changed

- Native build script now searches for release artifacts in target-specific directories when cross-compiling

## [9.5.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- Added `sortByMtime` option to `FindOptions` to sort results by modification time (most recent first) before applying limit
- Added streaming callback support to `grep()` function via optional `onMatch` parameter for real-time match notifications
- Exported `RequestOptions` type for timeout and abort signal configuration across native APIs
- Exported `fuzzyFind` function for fuzzy file path search with gitignore support
- Exported `FuzzyFindOptions`, `FuzzyFindMatch`, and `FuzzyFindResult` types for fuzzy search API
- Added `fuzzyFind` export for fuzzy file path search with gitignore support

### Changed

- Changed `grep()` and `fuzzyFind()` to support timeout and abort signal handling via `RequestOptions`
- Updated `GrepOptions` and `FuzzyFindOptions` to extend `RequestOptions` for consistent timeout/cancellation support
- Refactored `htmlToMarkdown()` to support timeout and abort signal handling

### Removed

- Removed `grepDirect()` function (use `grep()` instead)
- Removed `grepPool()` function (use `grep()` instead)
- Removed `terminate()` export from grep module
- Removed `terminateHtmlWorker` export from html module

### Fixed

- Fixed potential crashes when updating native binaries by using safe copy strategy that avoids overwriting in-memory binaries
