# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added color helpers `colorLuma` (perceptual luma), `relativeLuminance` (WCAG, linearized sRGB), and `hslToHex` to the color utilities. The luminance helpers parse `#rgb`/`#rrggbb` hex and 256-color palette indices, returning `undefined` for unparseable values.
- Added `peekFileEnds`, a single-open head-and-tail file peek helper that reuses the head bytes for the tail when the file fits the head window.

- Added `peekFileTail`, the tail mirror of `peekFile`: reads up to the last `maxBytes` of a file ending at EOF, reusing the same pooled-buffer strategy (no per-call allocation for small reads).

## [15.7.3] - 2026-05-31
### Added

- Added `getFastembedCacheDir` to return the FastEmbed model cache directory under ~/.omp/cache/fastembed

### Fixed

- Fixed `$flag` environment parsing to accept lowercase truthy values such as `y`, `true`, `yes`, and `on`

## [15.6.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Added an XDG-aware tiny-title model cache directory helper for coding-agent local title models.
