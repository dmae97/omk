 * - `sessionReplace`: caller asked for `{ clearScrollback: true }` on a forced
 *   render — clear viewport, clear scrollback (outside multiplexers).
 * - `historyRebuild`: a geometry change (terminal resize) left native history
 *   wrapped at the old size — clear viewport and scrollback so it rewraps at the
 *   new geometry. Also flushes deferred content-only rewrites.
 * - `liveRegionPinned`: ED3-risk/unknown foreground stream with a reported live
 *   suffix — optionally append newly sealed rows, then repaint the live/mutable
 *   tail without letting transient rows enter native history.
 * - `viewportRepaint`: rewrite the visible viewport in place. If `appendFrom`
 *   is set, emit those tail rows as scrollback growth first so streaming
 *   output reaches terminal history before the corrected viewport is drawn.
 * - `deferredShrink`: pure content shrink would re-expose rows already in
 *   native history. Keep row indices stable with blank tail padding, repaint
 *   only the viewport, and defer the real shorter replay to a checkpoint.
 * - `deferredTailRepaint`: a deferred history mutation also changed the active
 *   grid's bottom row; repaint only that row relative to the tracked hardware
 *   cursor so a bottom-anchored spinner can advance without rewriting rows that
 *   a slightly-scrolled reader can still see.
 * - `deferredMutation`: a row-inserting edit would reindex native scrollback
 *   while the user is scrolled. Defer all bytes until a safe rebuild checkpoint.
 * - `shrink`: trailing rows were dropped — clear extras inline.
 * - `diff`: differential repaint of visible rows / append new rows below.
