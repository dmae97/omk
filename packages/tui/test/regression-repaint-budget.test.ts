/**
 * Regression: repairing a row that changed above the viewport must not cost
 * the whole transcript. The repair repaint re-emits every row from the changed
 * one down, and each re-emitted row evicts an older row from the terminal's
 * finite scrollback. In a long session (an earlier prompt box or a late tool
 * result mutating far above the viewport) a single changed row re-emitted
 * hundreds of rows and pushed the beginning of the current report out of
 * scrollback — the report looked truncated when scrolling back.
 *
 * The repaint is now bounded to a few viewport screens: recent history is
 * still repaired, older rows keep their stale copy instead of being "fixed"
 * at the cost of the transcript.
