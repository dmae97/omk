/**
 * Claim Closure Graph V1 vocabulary.
 *
 * The flat `TaskSpec.claims` model answers "did this attempt satisfy its
 * predicates?". The closure graph answers the stricter question a verified
 * verdict needs: are all required claims closed by *qualified* witnesses —
 * bound to this source root and environment, not expired, from a source the
 * claim's policy trusts, independent enough to count separately — with no
 * counterexample, no unresolved side effect, and a complete workspace scope?
 *
 * Pure vocabulary: no behaviour, no I/O, no clock. Evaluation lives in
 * `claim-closure.ts`, structure checks in `claim-graph.ts`.
