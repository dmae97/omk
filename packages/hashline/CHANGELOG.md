# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

- Changed hashline payload continuations from `+TEXT` to `\TEXT`; use `\` for an explicit blank payload line.

### Added

- Added `parsePatchStreaming(diff)` and `PatchSection.applyPartialTo(text, options)` for incremental diff previews. Both tolerate a trailing in-flight op (no payload yet, or a per-token parse error mid-stream) instead of throwing or emitting a phantom empty-payload edit.
- Added `Executor.endStreaming()` — sibling of `end()` that drops a pending op with no accumulated payload rather than flushing it.

### Fixed

- Parser now skips markdown-style `# ...` lines when they directly precede a hashline operation, making model-generated explanatory rows in prompt examples non-blocking.
- Parser now treats a leading `\` on inline payload bodies as the payload delimiter, matching standalone payload rows.

### Removed

- Removed the `A-B!` / `A!` deletion operator. Use `A-B:` with the desired payload (or empty payload to blank the range) instead.

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

## [15.5.4] - 2026-05-27
### Added

- Added a high-level `Patcher` API with all-or-nothing `apply` and staged `prepare`/`commit` flows for multi-file patch updates
- Added pluggable `Filesystem` and `SnapshotStore` abstractions with built-in `NodeFilesystem`, `InMemoryFilesystem`, and `InMemorySnapshotStore` adapters
- Added patch parsing that consumes `¶PATH#HASH` hunk headers, validates section file hashes, and supports optional patch envelope markers
- Added tolerant input handling that strips read/search prefixes and supports optional `cwd`/fallback-path resolution when parsing patch payloads
- Added automatic line-ending and BOM normalization on read, with original encoding shape restored on write
- Added follow-up helpers `buildCompactDiffPreview` and `streamHashLines` for compact diff previews and chunked streaming of numbered lines
- Added stale-file-hash recovery that replays edits against snapshots and merges results onto current file content when direct hash validation fails
- Initial standalone release. Extracted from `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`.

### Fixed

- Fixed repeated patch application mutating cached `after_anchor` edits between target snapshots
- Fixed multi-section patching to preflight write policies and reject duplicate canonical targets before any section is committed
- Fixed mixed line-ending restoration to preserve the first newline style instead of rewriting ties to LF
