# Porting to pi-natives (N-API) — Field Notes

This is a practical guide for moving hot paths into `crates/pi-natives` and wiring them through the JS bindings. It exists to avoid the same failures happening twice.

## When to port

Port when any of these are true:

- The hot path runs in render loops, tight UI updates, or large batches.
- JS allocations dominate (string churn, regex backtracking, large arrays).
- You already have a JS baseline and can benchmark both versions side by side.
- The work is CPU-bound or blocking I/O that can run on the libuv thread pool.
- The work is async I/O that can run on Tokio's runtime (e.g., shell execution).

Avoid ports that depend on JS-only state or dynamic imports. N-API exports should be pure, data-in/data-out. Long-running work should go through `task::blocking` (CPU-bound/blocking I/O) or `task::future` (async I/O) with cancellation.

## Anatomy of a native export

**Rust side:**
- Implementation lives in `crates/pi-natives/src/<module>.rs`. If you add a new module, register it in `crates/pi-natives/src/lib.rs`.
- Export with `#[napi]` and `#[napi(js_name = "...")]` to keep JS-facing camelCase names. Use `#[napi(object)]` for structs.
- Use `task::blocking(tag, cancel_token, work)` (see `crates/pi-natives/src/task.rs`) for CPU-bound or blocking work. Use `task::future(env, tag, work)` for async work that needs Tokio (e.g., shell sessions). Pass a `CancelToken` when you expose `timeoutMs` or `AbortSignal`.

**JS side:**
- `packages/natives/src/bindings.ts` holds the base `NativeBindings` interface.
- `packages/natives/src/<module>/types.ts` defines TS types and augments `NativeBindings` via declaration merging.
- `packages/natives/src/native.ts` imports each `<module>/types.ts` file to activate the declarations.
- `packages/natives/src/<module>/index.ts` wraps the `native` binding from `packages/natives/src/native.ts`.
- `packages/natives/src/native.ts` loads the addon and `validateNative` enforces required exports.
- `packages/natives/src/index.ts` re-exports the wrapper for callers in `packages/*`.

## Porting checklist

1) **Add the Rust implementation**
- Put the core logic in a plain Rust function.
- If it’s a new module, add it to `crates/pi-natives/src/lib.rs`.
- Expose it with `#[napi(js_name = "...")]` to keep camelCase names stable.
- Keep signatures owned and simple: `String`, `Vec<String>`, `Uint8Array`, or `Either<JsString, Uint8Array>` for large string/byte inputs.
- For CPU-bound or blocking work, use `task::blocking`; for async work, use `task::future`. Pass a `CancelToken` and call `heartbeat()` inside long loops.

2) **Wire JS bindings**
- Add the types and `NativeBindings` augmentation in `packages/natives/src/<module>/types.ts`.
- Import `./<module>/types` in `packages/natives/src/native.ts` to trigger declaration merging.
- Add a wrapper in `packages/natives/src/<module>/index.ts` that calls `native`.
- Re-export from `packages/natives/src/index.ts`.

3) **Update native validation**
- Add `checkFn("newExport")` in `validateNative` (`packages/natives/src/native.ts`).

4) **Add benchmarks**
- Put benchmarks next to the owning package (`packages/tui/bench`, `packages/natives/bench`, or `packages/coding-agent/bench`).
- Include a JS baseline and native version in the same run.
- Use `performance.now()` and a fixed iteration count.
- Keep the benchmark inputs small and realistic (actual data seen in the hot path).

5) **Build the native binary**
- `bun --cwd=packages/natives run build:native`
- Use `bun --cwd=packages/natives run dev:native` for debug builds (`pi_natives.dev.node`) and set `OMP_DEV=1` when loading it.

6) **Run the benchmark**
- `bun run packages/<pkg>/bench/<bench>.ts` (or `bun --cwd=packages/natives run bench`)

7) **Decide on usage**
- If native is slower, **keep JS** and leave the native export unused.
- If native is faster, switch call sites to the native wrapper.

## Pain points and how to avoid them

### 1) Stale `pi_natives.node` prevents new exports
The loader prefers the platform-tagged binary in `packages/natives/native` (`pi_natives.<platform>-<arch>.node`). When `OMP_DEV=1`, it will load `pi_natives.dev.node` instead. There is also a fallback `pi_natives.node`. Compiled binaries extract to `~/.omp/natives/<version>/pi_natives.<platform>-<arch>.node`. If any of these are stale, exports won’t update.

**Fix:** remove the stale file before rebuilding.

```bash
rm packages/natives/native/pi_natives.linux-x64.node
rm packages/natives/native/pi_natives.node
bun --cwd=packages/natives run build:native
```

If you’re running a compiled binary, delete the cached addon directory:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.omp/natives/<version>
```

Then verify the export exists in the binary:

```bash
bun -e 'const tag = `${process.platform}-${process.arch}`; const mod = require(`./packages/natives/native/pi_natives.${tag}.node`); console.log(Object.keys(mod).includes("newExport"));'
```

### 2) “Missing exports” errors from `validateNative`
This is **good** — it prevents silent mismatches. When you see this:

```
Native addon missing exports ... Missing: visibleWidth
```

it means your binary is stale, the Rust `#[napi(js_name = "...")]` doesn’t match the JS name, or the export never compiled in. Fix the build and the naming mismatch, don’t weaken validation.

### 3) Rust signature mismatch
Keep it simple and owned. `String`, `Vec<String>`, and `Uint8Array` work. Avoid references like `&str` in public exports. If you need structured data, wrap it in `#[napi(object)]` structs.

### 4) Benchmarking mistakes
- Don’t compare different inputs or allocations.
- Keep JS and native using identical input arrays.
- Run both in the same benchmark file to avoid skew.

## Benchmark template

```ts
const ITERATIONS = 2000;

function bench(name: string, fn: () => void): number {
	const start = performance.now();
	for (let i = 0; i < ITERATIONS; i++) fn();
	const elapsed = performance.now() - start;
	console.log(`${name}: ${elapsed.toFixed(2)}ms total (${(elapsed / ITERATIONS).toFixed(4)}ms/op)`);
	return elapsed;
}

bench("feature/js", () => {
	jsImpl(sample);
});

bench("feature/native", () => {
	nativeImpl(sample);
});
```

## Verification checklist

- `validateNative` passes (no missing exports).
- `NativeBindings` is augmented in `packages/natives/src/<module>/types.ts` and the wrapper is re-exported in `packages/natives/src/index.ts`.
- `Object.keys(require(...))` includes your new export.
- Bench numbers recorded in the PR/notes.
- Call site updated **only if** native is faster or equal.

## Rule of thumb

- If native is slower, **do not switch**. Keep the export for future work, but the TUI should stay on the faster path.
- If native is faster, switch the call site and keep the benchmark in place to catch regressions.
