# omp-rpc

Typed Python bindings for the `omp --mode rpc` protocol used by the coding agent.

This package wraps the newline-delimited JSON RPC transport exposed by the CLI and
provides:

- typed command methods for the stable RPC surface
- typed startup options for common `omp --mode rpc` flags such as thinking level,
  tool selection, prompt appends, provider session IDs, and headless session toggles
- typed protocol models for state, bash results, compaction, and session stats
- a process-backed client that manages request correlation over stdio
- typed per-event listeners plus a typed catch-all notification hook
- helpers for collecting prompt runs and handling extension UI requests in manual or headless mode

## Basic Usage

```python
from omp_rpc import RpcClient

with RpcClient(provider="anthropic", model="claude-sonnet-4-5") as client:
    state = client.get_state()
    print(state.model.id if state.model else "no model")

    turn = client.prompt_and_wait("Reply with just the word hello")
    print(turn.require_assistant_text())
```

The wrapper also exposes the common RPC startup flags directly, so scripts do not
need to build `extra_args` by hand:

```python
from omp_rpc import RpcClient

with RpcClient(
    model="openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",
    thinking="high",
    no_session=True,
    no_skills=True,
    no_rules=True,
    tools=("read", "edit", "write"),
    append_system_prompt="Focus on reproducible benchmark behavior.",
) as client:
    print(client.get_state().thinking_level)
```

For orchestration hosts, the wrapper also exposes typed event hooks and a simple
way to seed todos before the first prompt:

```python
from omp_rpc import MessageUpdateEvent, RpcClient

def on_message_update(event: MessageUpdateEvent) -> None:
    assistant_event = event.assistant_message_event
    if assistant_event.get("type") == "text_delta":
        print(assistant_event["delta"], end="", flush=True)

with RpcClient(model="openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6", no_session=True) as client:
    client.on_message_update(on_message_update)
    client.set_todos(
        [
            "Map the read and edit tool surface.",
            "Exercise the supported edit paths.",
            "Write concrete findings and gaps.",
        ]
    )
    client.prompt_and_wait("Evaluate the current tool behavior.")
```

`set_todos()` accepts either a flat list of todo strings/items or explicit
phases, and `get_state().todo_phases` returns the typed current todo state.

By default the client runs:

```bash
omp --mode rpc
```

You can also point it at a custom command, which is useful inside this repo while
developing against the Bun entrypoint:

```python
from omp_rpc import RpcClient

with RpcClient(
    command=[
        "bun",
        "packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts",
        "--mode",
        "rpc",
        "--provider",
        "anthropic",
        "--model",
        "claude-sonnet-4-5",
    ],
) as client:
    print(client.get_state().session_id)
```

## Extension UI Requests

Extensions in RPC mode can ask the host for input. Those requests are available as
typed `ExtensionUiRequest` instances:

```python
request = client.next_ui_request(timeout=5.0)

if request.method == "confirm":
    client.send_ui_confirmation(request.id, True)
elif request.method in {"input", "editor"}:
    client.send_ui_value(request.id, "approved")
```

For non-interactive scripts, you can install a default headless policy instead of
handling every request manually:

```python
with RpcClient(model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5") as client:
    client.install_headless_ui()
    turn = client.prompt_and_wait("needs ui-safe automation")
    print(turn.assistant_text)
```

That helper ignores passive UI notifications (`notify`, `setStatus`, `setWidget`,
`setTitle`, `set_editor_text`), answers `confirm` with `False`, and cancels
`select`/`input`/`editor` requests unless you provide explicit values.

## Error Handling and Retained History

The client now surfaces more of the transport edge cases that the wire protocol
allows:

- id-less `parse` and unknown-command failures are correlated back to the
  waiting request when they can be matched unambiguously
- late `prompt` / `abort_and_prompt` scheduling failures cause
  `prompt_and_wait()` and `wait_for_idle()` to raise instead of timing out
- unmatched background error responses are exposed through
  `client.protocol_errors` and `client.on_protocol_error(...)`
- listener exceptions no longer kill the stdout reader thread; they are exposed
  through `client.listener_errors` and `client.on_listener_error(...)`

For long-lived hosts, retained event and stderr history is bounded by default:

```python
from omp_rpc import RpcClient

with RpcClient(max_event_history=20_000, max_stderr_chunks=256) as client:
    ...
```

If a single prompt streams more events than `max_event_history` allows,
`prompt_and_wait()` raises a clear error so hosts can increase the limit instead
of silently losing earlier events.

## Text Helpers

`assistant_text()` and `message_text()` now return visible text blocks only.
If a host explicitly needs reasoning text too, use the `*_with_thinking`
helpers:

```python
from omp_rpc import assistant_text, assistant_text_with_thinking

visible = assistant_text(message)
full = assistant_text_with_thinking(message)
```

## Protocol Reference

The canonical wire protocol still lives in the repo at
[`docs/rpc.md`](../../docs/rpc.md).
